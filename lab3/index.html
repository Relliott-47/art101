					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>[I'm having this issue with connecting the css with the html for my profile picture, I still haven't figured it out. I'm also having another issue in regards to linking my screenshots below, when my first attempt didn't work I copied the code of my partner and also professor mode's code on the assignment itself and yet I haven't been able to figure out why my file structure screenshot won't show in the bottom.] But now I've figured it out, for the homepage picture my issue was that the width needed to be edited in the html not the css. Then for the file structure screenshot I just made a mistake with the class putting file instead of image.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I made some minor mistakes that it took a long time and some brute force to figure out. I still don't really feel like I created a files tructure though because that was already created for us.</p>
